#### Knowledge Inference
KICoDi works by receiving a sentence and separating it into a `subject-predicted, object` tuple. The main task is to infer new tuples from new and possibly valid objects.

For the task related to the `subject-predicted, object` clasification we use the [Semnantic Role Labeling](https://demo.allennlp.org/semantic-role-labeling) tool from [The Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence](https://allenai.org).
By determining the structure of the sentence we can make the clasification and pass them as arguments to our predictor function.
