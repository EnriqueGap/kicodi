#### Knowledge Inference
To test KICoDi select one of the sentences from the input examples below and from this sentence the system will generate a sentence that could be validated.

For the task related to the `subject-predicted, object` clasification we use the [Semnantic Role Labeling](https://demo.allennlp.org/semantic-role-labeling) tool from [The Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence](https://allenai.org).
By determining the structure of the sentence we can make the clasification and pass them as arguments to our predictor function.
