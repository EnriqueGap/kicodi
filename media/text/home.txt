KICoDi is a self-attention based Neural Language Model trained with different Knowledge Bases. The main application of KICoDi is focused on supporting biomedical research related to the study of
nonCommunicable Diseases.

The goal of trained NLM is infer parts of semantic structures. The NLM learns from training samples of the form `subject-predicted, object` tuples. 

KICoDI is a Transformer-Based NLM trained with different Knowledge Bases builded from combinations of Information-Extractions Methods and a dataset of scientific paper abstracts related to
nine different nonCommunicable Disease domains:
- Breast Cancer
- Lung Cancer
- Prostate Cancer
- Colorectal Cancer
- Gastric Cancer
- Cardiovascular Disease
- Chronic Respiratory Diseases
- Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus
- Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
